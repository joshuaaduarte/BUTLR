#  Introduction
BUTLR is a new kind of planner that aims to revolutionize the way people plan and reach their goals. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, BUTLR actively learns the user's habits and schedule to provide personalized planning and goal-setting solutions. The goal of BUTLR is to make planning and goal-setting as effective and efficient as possible, so that users can focus on what really matters: making progress towards their goals.

# Problem
